  ### Description

  This is a CLI application using Node and the NPMs Jest and Inquirer. Jest was used to test the code while Inquirer was used to ask questions to be generated on an HTML page. The user, who is assumed to be the manager so it starts with them, begins answering questios about the manager. It then gives options to add either an engineer or an intern, if neither is needed it stops the questions. It then uses all user answers and generates a new page, in "dist" folder, with all added employees.
